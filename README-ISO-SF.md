## ISO version of Czo Rescue Debian

A live [Linux Debian Rescue](https://gitlab.com/czo/czo-rescue-debian), which started from my own Linux Arch [SystemRescue fork](https://gitlab.com/czo/czo-system-rescue).

It's has zfs binaries + 3ware raid + my configuration files (.bashrc/.vimrc/.tmux.conf).

Xfce has its whisker menu and its xfce4-xkb plugin. There is also firefox-esr and firefox-ublock-origin.

Version 11.6 contains kernel/5.10.0-21-amd64 and zfs/2.0.3-9
